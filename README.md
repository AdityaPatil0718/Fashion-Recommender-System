**Fashion Recommender System**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the Fashion Recommender System repository! This project aims to provide a personalized fashion recommendation experience using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system analyzes images of clothing items to understand their visual features and recommends similar items based on user preferences.
Fashion Recommender System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


**Features:**

CNN-based Image Analysis: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to extract visual features from clothing images.
Personalized Recommendations: Recommends fashion items based on user preferences and browsing history.
Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate large datasets and growing user bases.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system and explore recommended items.

**Requirements:**

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
Keras (>=2.0)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Flask (for web application, optional)


**Usage:**

Training the Model:

Prepare your dataset of fashion images.
Use the provided scripts or notebooks to train the CNN model on your dataset.
Generating Recommendations:

Once the model is trained, use it to generate recommendations based on user input or browsing history.
Implement recommendation algorithms such as content-based filtering or collaborative filtering to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Web Application (Optional):

If desired, deploy the model as a web application using Flask or other web frameworks.
Allow users to interact with the system through a user-friendly interface to receive fashion recommendations.
